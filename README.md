# DNN_Profile_Classification_Keras_Tensorflow
This simple code creates a deep neural network using keras running on top of tensorflow. The user has the option of selecting a 1D convolutional neural network or a standard deep neural network. The DNN is implemented to classify power consumption into weekends and weekdays. This is only implemented for a small number of training examples (hence the moderate performance...). A larger data set is needed in order to achieve adaquete performance. In order to run the code, tensorflow and keras must first be installed.

The DNN.py class contains the neural network code, reads in the data, trains and then tests the model.

The 4 .csv files contain the training / testing features and labels.
