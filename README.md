# DNN_Profile_Classification_Keras_Tensorflow
This simple code creates a deep neural network using keras running on top of tensorflow. The user has the option of selecting a 1D convolutional neural network or a standard deep neural network. The DNN is implemented to classify power consumption into weekends and weekdays. This is only implemented for a small number of training examples (hence the moderate performance...). A larger data set is needed in order to achieve adaquete performance. In order to run the code, tensorflow and keras must first be installed.
